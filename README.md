## What is FALL3D
FALL3D is a 3D model for atmospheric passive transport and deposition of 
particles, aerosols, and radionuclides.
The model, originally developed for inert volcanic particles (tephra), has a 
track record of 50+ publications on different model applications and code 
validation, as well as an ever-growing community of users worldwide, including 
academia, private, research, and several institutions tasked with operational 
forecast of volcanic ash clouds.
